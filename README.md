Gemini Voice Bot ü§ñÔ∏èüó£Ô∏èA conversational AI voice bot that uses Google's Gemini Pro API to listen, understand, and respond with voice. Interact with a powerful language model without touching your keyboard.üé¨ Demo(It's highly recommended to add a GIF or a short video demonstrating your bot in action. You can record your screen using tools like Giphy Capture or Kap.)üåü About The ProjectGemini Voice Bot is a Python application that provides a hands-free conversational experience with Google's state-of-the-art Gemini AI. It's designed to be a simple, yet powerful, framework for creating voice-based AI assistants.The core functionality is straightforward:Listens: It actively listens for a wake word to start the conversation.Transcribes: It uses a speech recognition library to convert your spoken words into text.Thinks: It sends the transcribed text to the Gemini API.Responds: It receives the text response from Gemini and uses a text-to-speech engine to speak it back to you.‚ú® Built WithPythonGoogle Gemini API (google-generativeai)SpeechRecognition LibraryPyAudio (for microphone access)pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)üöÄ Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed:Python 3.9+A Google Gemini API KeyYou can get your free API key from Google AI Studio.InstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Mraprguild/GeminiVoiceBot.git
cd GeminiVoiceBot
Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:(Create a requirements.txt file with the necessary libraries if you don't have one yet. It should look something like this:)google-generativeai
SpeechRecognition
PyAudio
pyttsx3
Then, run:pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your API Key:It's best practice to use an environment variable to store your API key. Create a file named .env in the root of your project directory and add your key:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
Make sure to add .env to your .gitignore file to prevent your key from being committed to GitHub!üéôÔ∏è UsageOnce the installation is complete, you can run the main script to start the bot.python main.py  # or the name of your main script
Say the wake word (e.g., "Hey Gemini") and then ask your question. The bot will listen, process your request, and respond with voice. To end the session, you can say a shutdown command like "goodbye".‚öôÔ∏è Configuration(This is an optional section. If your script allows for configuration, describe it here. Below is an example.)You can adjust the bot's behavior by modifying the config.py file (or a similar configuration section in your main script):Wake Word: Change the phrase that activates the bot.Voice/Rate/Volume: Adjust the text-to-speech voice, speaking rate, and volume.Microphone Index: If you have multiple microphones, you can specify which one to use.ü§ù ContributingContributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
